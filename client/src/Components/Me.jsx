    I am a passionate developer. 
    I have been studing all by my self for more than one year, then i came to Barcelona and while i was looking for a job, i found Henry.
    Henry teach me a lot of things, nowdays i can say that i am a Full Stack Developer, i feel really confortable using technologies such as 
    React and Redux for the fron end part and Express with NodeJS for the back part. But the most important thing i can take from Henry is the
    ability of learn. Now i know that if you give a few weeks i can manage any new framwork.
