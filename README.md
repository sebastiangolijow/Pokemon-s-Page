# Pokemon-s-Page
Here you will find some information about all the pokemons.
I made this page with React + Redux for the front end part, NodeJS(Express) for the back end and PostgreSQL + Sequelize for the data base.
At first you will find a landing page with the 3 first pokemons, as in the game, you need to select your first pokemon to enter, then in the home page you can see all the pokemons and filter them, you can also create your own pokemons, look for it in the pokedex page and at the end you will see a filter page where woyu can filter then by types.
